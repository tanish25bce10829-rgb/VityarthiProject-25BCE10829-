## 📖 About the Project

**Speed Logistics** is a solution designed to solve the problem of inaccurate delivery time estimation in local logistics. While map apps provide travel time based on traffic, they often fail to account for specific vehicle limitations and warehouse handling times.

This application serves as a **Decision Support System (DSS)** for dispatchers. It takes specific inputs (Distance and Vehicle Type) and processes them through a custom algorithm that combines:
1.  **Kinematics:** $Time = Distance / Speed$
2.  **Operational Overhead:** Fixed buffer times for packaging, labeling, and vehicle loading.

The result is a highly accurate "Total Delivery Time" displayed in a modern, high-contrast Dark Mode interface suitable for professional environments.

## ✨ Key Features

* **Multi-Modal Transport Support:**
    * 🚲 **Bike:** Optimized for short, urban trips (40 km/h).
    * 🚗 **Car:** Standard speed for medium-range deliveries (60 km/h).
    * 🚁 **Drone:** High-speed aerial delivery for urgent packages (100 km/h).
* **Granular Time Breakdown:** unlike simple calculators, this tool separates "Travel Time" (Physics) from "Handling Time" (Logistics), providing transparency.
* **Robust Input Validation:** The system employs `try-except` blocks to prevent crashes if a user inputs non-numeric characters.
* **Modern GUI (Dark Mode):**
    * Built with a custom color palette (`#2c3e50` Midnight Blue).
    * Uses Hex-code styling for a "Stark Industries" aesthetic.
    * Features high-readability fonts (Helvetica & Courier).

## ⚙️ Technical Architecture

This project is built using the **Event-Driven Programming** paradigm.

* **Language:** Python 3.10+
* **GUI Framework:** `tkinter` (Standard Python Interface to Tcl/Tk).
* **Logic:**
    * **Input Layer:** Captures raw strings from Entry widgets.
    * **Processing Layer:** Converts strings to floats, maps vehicle types to integer speeds, and computes time.
    * **Presentation Layer:** Formats the output string with newline characters (`\n`) for a receipt-style display.

**Test 3: Invalid Input (Error Check)**
* **Distance:** `abc` (Type letters instead of numbers)
* **Vehicle:** Any
* **Expected Result:** A popup error message saying "Please enter a valid number."
